I"H<p>CatchEye is a solution providing accessible and affordable retina screenings that can detect Diabetic retinopathy - an eye disease linked to diabetes that can lead to full blindness if left untreated.</p>

<p>I worked on this project with Naima Volz, Filip Finfando, Raschek Schestra and Feiyi Su at EIT Digital Summer School in Lisbon with a topic of Longer Independent Living, organized by ISCTE and BGI. Together we won the award for “Best Entrepreneurial Team”.</p>

<p>CactchEye is built around a portable 3D printed EyeFundusScope developed at <a href="https://www.aicos.fraunhofer.pt/en/home.html">Fraunhofer Portugal</a>. This device contains optical lenses allowing a regular smartphone to take an image of a patients retina (the back of their eye).</p>

<p>Our task was to come up with a viable business model using this technology and turning it into a scaleable startup that would be attractive to investors.</p>

<p>First we had to do extensive market research on existing solutions.</p>

<p>We conducted interviews with opthamologist at a hospital, called a director of a nursing home in Germany and collected insights that forced us to go back and rethink our ideas.</p>

<p>We went from a self-service check-up booth to considering selling the device to GPs (general practicioners). We thought about placing the device in retirement home and also pharmacies. For one reason or another, neither of these proved to be a viable option.</p>

<p>It took a lot of dead ends to reach our final idea, but that is also what made much more convincing. We decided to place our device in Retail Clinics operating in the US. They are a channel providing basic healthcare services at affordable prices. There are already 2800 such locations spread around the US and their market is growing. They are frequented by diabetics, as they already offer diabetic</p>

<p>We took care in polishing our pitch, prepared a good story. As we were pitching to a jury knowledgeable in the healthcare industry we had to be accurate - not saying diagnosis, when we mean screening and not describing confusing FDA premarket notification with the FDA approval.</p>

<p>Everything was explained clearly using visuals that</p>

<p><em><center>Our milestones and associated funding needs</center></em></p>

<p>Since we expect the jury to ask some questions, we had a couple of backup slides ready</p>

<p>Given the time we had and the complexity of the healthcare industry I’m proud of what we were able to put together.

<p>Since we won the Summer School, I was asked to repeat our pitch to serve as an example for the ~400 new students at the EIT Digital Master School Kick-off in Trento before they started with their business challenge.</p>
