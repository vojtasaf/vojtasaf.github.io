I"<p>Currently I‚Äôm pursuing my Master‚Äôs in <strong>Human Computer Interaction and¬†Design</strong> with a minor in <strong>Innovation and Entrepreneurship</strong> as part of the <strong>EIT Digital</strong> double-degree programme.</p>

<p>My approach to design is holistic, rooted in rigorous research. I have analytical &amp; critical thinking and I like to question any assumptions. At the same time, I know when to throw wild ideas or keep on listening. I‚Äôm capable of facilitating the iterative design/development process, I can break down big tasks, prioritize and plan a few steps ahead while being flexible and ready to adapt in an agile fashion. I keep an eye on the business side of things and consider the ethical &amp; societal impact of our design choices.</p>

<p>I do try to improve my skills constantly and have the <a href="/files/GAIQ.pdf">Google Analytics Individual Qualification</a> as well as the <a href="/files/PSM1.pdf">Professional Scrum Master I</a> certification.</p>

<p>First year of the EIT Digital Master School. I applied for the programme since I knew I want to take a deeper dive into HCI and enjoyed studying abroad at numerous occasions (exchange in the US &amp; BEST Summer courses). Aalto has been the best university I studied at and allowed me to pursue my interests by taking courses such as Digital Ethics (take a look at our <a href="/files/poster.pdf">poster</a>), FinTech Seminar (check out my <a href="/files/psd2.pdf">essay</a> on PSD2) or Design for Transhuman Systems. No wonder I ended up with 14 credits more than required.</p>

I enjoyed that class very much and scored among the best students that ever took it. Another intriguining class that I had was SW Reverse Engineering with practical projects streghtening my awareness in terms of computer security. Also learned a bit of Spanish.</p>
