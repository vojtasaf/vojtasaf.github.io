As a project for the User Interface Construction course we were developing a solution that would digitalize the process of applying for a government ID in Namibia.

Just like any other project, I started with **research** to learn about our users and the context. I managed to find a great report by ID4D that explained the procedure of applying for an Namibian ID in detail. Our first individual assignment was to compline a report that would introduce the background of the problem, identify challenges, describe the user & their task and propose a solution in the form of an conversational interface as well as its limitations. You can check out my individual report [here][individual].

For the following group assignment I teamed up with Federico Macchi and Mario López Batres. We've been asked to eleborate on our work from the individual assignment and create an **interactive GUI**. As the choice of the platform and tool was entirely up to us, we decided to develop the solution using **Angular** in order to expand our skillset beyond the usual prototyping tools. You can try out our prototype [here][app] *(It is only optimized for mobile, so in case you're currently on desktop, I suggest changing the device mode - F12: Toggle device toolbar)*.

My part of the development consisted of input validation, modals & the final step of the form. Our solution had to be documented in a report, where I performed guidelines review for both **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics** and **Schneiderman's 8 Golden Rules** and discussed selected guidelines from **Smith & Mosier**. I also created an **UML** [flowchart][flowchart] describing the structure of the interaction.

As the application was intented to be used by all citizens, accessibility was an important consideration. Therefore we followed the **WCAG 2** guidelines and checked them by an automated tool. Our solution would allow a citizen to take care of their ID card in only one visit instead of two while maintaining the needed level of security. The web application was selected as a platform since it can be easily linked to from a government website and does not require the user to install an app that they would only use once.
