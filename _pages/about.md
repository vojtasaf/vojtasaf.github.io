Currently I’m pursuing my Master’s in **Human Computer Interaction and Design** with a minor in **Innovation and Entrepreneurship** as part of the **EIT Digital** double-degree programme.

My approach to design is holistic, rooted in rigorous research. I have analytical & critical thinking and I like to question any assumptions. At the same time, I know when to throw wild ideas or keep on listening. I'm capable of facilitating the iterative design/development process, I can break down big tasks, prioritize and plan a few steps ahead while being flexible and ready to adapt in an agile fashion. I keep an eye on the business side of things and consider the ethical & societal impact of our design choices.

I do try to improve my skills constantly and I have completed the [Google Analytics Individual Qualification][gaiq] as well as the [Professional Scrum Master I][psm1] certification.

## Education:
#### University of Trento
<small>2019 - now</small>

Second year of my Master's programme with specialization in **Cognitive Interaction**. Currently I'm learning more about Participatory Design, Affective Computing and the psychology of Social Interaction while improving my Prototyping skills.

#### Aalto University
<small>2018 - 2019</small>

First year of the [EIT Digital Master School][eit]. I applied for the programme since I knew that I want to take a deeper dive into HCI and enjoyed studying abroad at numerous occasions before (exchange in the US & [BEST][best] Summer courses). Aalto has been the best university I studied at and allowed me to pursue my interests by taking courses such as Digital Ethics (take a look at our [poster][poster]), FinTech Seminar (check out my [essay][psd2] on PSD2) or Design for Transhuman Systems. No wonder I ended up with 14 credits more than required.

#### Czech Technical University in Prague
<small>2014 - 2018</small>

Bachelor in **Informatics** at the [Faculty of Information Technology][fit], majoring in **Information Systems and Management**.
Studying here gave me solid technical foundations in IT and plenty of interesting courses to take such as 3D Printing, Data Mining, Managerial Psychology or Law and Informatics.

#### University of Texas at El Paso
<small>Fall 2016</small>

Semester abroad spent studying Computer Science. This is where I found out about HCI as field of study thanks to prof. Nigel Ward's course. I took his class as I believed that it would help me improve doing my job at the CTU's Computing and Information Centre back in Prague. I enjoyed that class very much and scored among the best students that ever took it. Another intriguining class that I had was SW Reverse Engineering with practical projects streghtening my awareness in terms of computer security. Also learned a bit of Spanish.
